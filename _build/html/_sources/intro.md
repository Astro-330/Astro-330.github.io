# Astro 330 Lab Book

As we make our way through the course, the Lecture Notes and Lab Assignments will be added to this book as chapters on the left. You will be able to git-pull to download the relevant notebooks, as well as view the assignments locally. They will also be online. 

:::{note}
We recommend you spawn up your own notebooks for assignments, pushing them to the relevant github directory via github classroom. If you work directly in the pulled assignent document, it may be overwritten or have merge conflicts when you next try to pull. You will be able to copy the downloaded files, so you can make a copy of the Lab if you wish to work directly on it.
