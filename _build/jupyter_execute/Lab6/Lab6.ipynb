    "## Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The [UVJ diagram](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab2f8c/pdf) is a useful diagnostic tool in extragalactic astronomy which allows one to relatively accurately diagnose a galaxy as star forming or quiescent, even in the presence of dust. You can read more at the link if you're unfamiliar. It is composed by plotting the \"U-V\" color of the galaxy against the \"V-J\" colors. You'll likely know U and V (these are from the Johnsons-Cousin's filter system). J is a filter in the near infrared. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we're going to write a function that can create a UVJ diagram for subsets of our data, cutting on mass and redshift. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to access the following columns in the data (besides redshift, which you've already handled):\n",
    "\n",
    "- stellar mass: the mass of all the stars in the galaxy. (column: `lmass`, flagged value of -1)\n",
    "- star formation rate: rate at which galaxy is forming stars. (column: `lsfr`, flagged value of -99.0)\n",
    "- U band flux density (column: `l153`, flagged value of -99.0)\n",
    "- V band flux density (column: `l155`, flagged value of -99.0)\n",
    "- J band flux density (column: `l161`, flagged value of -99.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3.1 \n",
    "\n",
    "For step one, we need to be able to filter our dataframe for particular mass and redshift ranges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function, `select_galaxies()`, which takes as arguments `M, delta_M, z, delta_z` (and our dataframe). \n",
    "It should then return a df of only systems between M-deltaM to M+deltaM, and z-deltaz to z+deltaz. The columns it should return are the ones specified above, plus 'z'.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is actually a column in `rf_df` called `z`, that contains the spec_z if available or the peak z if not. At the time of writing, I cannot determine why this column was not included in the merge. In any case, set `df['z']` equal to `rf_df.z` before continuing, as you'll use it below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "All masses and sfrs are in log units. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try your function out using a mass of 10, delta M of 0.5 (i.e., a bin from 9.5 - 10.5), a redshift of 1, and a delta z of 0.25."

    "\n",
    "Great, we can now get subsamples in mass/redshift bins. This is important because the UVJ diagram actually changes as a function of mass and redshift. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to get the colors out. Write a function `get_colors()` which takes the same arguments as your `select_galaxies()` function above. Inside, it should run `select_galaxies` passing through the arguments, and then from the resulting data frame, calculate U-V and U-J (see below). Add these as columns to said dataframe with names 'U-V' and 'V-J' and return it. \n",

    "\n",
