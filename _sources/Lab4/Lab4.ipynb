    "# Lab 4:  Fitting a Model to Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will begin to build various tools to fit a model to data.  The goal is to understand, implement and compare chi2 and MCMC fitting routines to fake data.    In Lab 5, we will apply these tools to real spectroscopic data from Keck / DEIMOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of the lab are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use python modules to perform $\\chi^2$ fits on data\n",
    "2. Write and compare to your own $\\chi^2$ algorithm\n",
    "3. Explore sampling algorithms\n",
    "4. Write an MCMC algorithmm and compare to $\\chi^2$ results\n",

The data (Table 1) are available in the A330 public page under Data Access as well as in your Git directories (as the file is small).   Please report your best fit values and errors on these values.

    "Repeat the question above, however, this time write your own script to solve this problem by evaluating chi2 on a grid of m and b values. You should write a `chi2()` function that reads in 4 arguments `m,b,data_x,data_y,unc_y` (though you can call them what you want). You should then write a `fit_line()` or `minimize_chi2()` function that will, across your grid of $m$ and $b$ values, evaluate chi2 using your `chi2()` function. You may use the values above to guide your grid, making sure the grid spans at least 2-sigma in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the chi2 values for all grid points. We suggest creating an array, `chi2_image`, which is a shape characterized by the lengthd of your `m_grid` and `b_grid`s. Then, as you double-for-loop over `m` and `b` values and calculate `chi2`, you can set `chi2_image[i,j]` to the output chi2 value. \n",

    "While chi2 fitting is reliable for determining the best-fit values, it is not always easy to estimate errors on these parameters. For example, in the above example, we had to explicitly initialize a grid of parameters to fit on, and as soon as this grid has to get finely spaced, or moves into any number of dimensions > 2, everything gets much more computationally expensive to calculate, and understanding the chi-squared \"surface\" in multi-D becomes difficult. Additionally, we had to narrow in our range of $m$ and $b$ values to get it to work, but there may actually be a better solution elsewhere in parameter space that we're not accessing. "
